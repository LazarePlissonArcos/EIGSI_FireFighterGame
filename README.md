# FireFighterGame

## Description:
This Java-based simulation game is designed to model and manage firefighting operations 
in various environmental conditions. Users can select the number of firefighters, when they will 
be able to act, what they will do, where, wind conditions, and maps for simulation. 
The program provides options for manual or automatic firefighting operations, 
allowing users to strategize and optimize fire containment efforts.
Development of an automatic selection of firefighting operations, that select the best place to act.

## Features:
Firefighter Number Selection: Choose the number of firefighters available in the simulation.
Wind Condition Selection: Simulate different wind conditions, including no wind, north, east, south, and west winds.
Map Selection: Choose from a variety of maps to run the simulation.
Manual and Automatic Operations: Engage in firefighting efforts manually or let the program automatically determine the best course of action.
Fire Propagation and Control: Visualize how fires spread and are controlled under different conditions.
Simulation Time Control: Control the duration of each simulation scenario.
Installation

## Usage:
To start the simulation:
Run Main.java.
Follow the on-screen prompts to input the number of firefighters, select wind conditions, choose a map, and set the response time.
Choose the mode of action (Manual or Automatic).
The simulation will start, displaying the firefighting process on the chosen map.
